Enhance your posts with Google Maps.  Use the Easy Maps plugin to easily create more dynamic content with an inline editor.

== Description ==

In literally just a few seconds, you can add beautiful Google maps to any of your posts with Easy Maps (watch the video below to see it in action!).  
As you write, Easy Maps can instantly find towns, restaurants, attraction, hotels and more.  And because it's connected with Trippy.com, 
using Easy Maps in a post will automagically get your post listed as a resource on Trippy.com, which means more new readers for your blog.
