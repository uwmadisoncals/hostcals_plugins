The most comprehensive & user-friendly mapping solution for WordPress

== Description ==

We are working hard on delivering the best mapping solution available – helping you to share your favorite spots and tracks.

Display locations and directions on your WordPress site. Organize customized icons in tidy layers on a variety of maps and even in augmented reality browsers. Leaflet Maps Marker is your individual Geo-CMS that features highest security standards and a moral code. 

With Leaflet Maps Marker, you can

* pin your favorites places with **markers**,
* show **directions** for your locations,
* use integrated **address search** for quick results,
* choose from over **1000 free, customizable icons** from [Maps Icons Collection](https://mapicons.mapsmarker.com),
* add **popup description text or images** for each marker,
* organize your markers in **layers**,
* choose an **individual basemap, size and zoom level** for each marker and layer map
* display your maps by just adding a **shortcode** - e.g. [mapsmarker marker="1"] - to posts, pages, widgets and templates
* on the basemap of your choice: **Google Maps** (road, satellite, hybrid, terrain), **Open Street Map**, **Bing** (aerial, aerials + labels, road), **Mapbox** (road, satellite) and any **custom WMTS-map**
* and even in **augmented-reality** browsers like Wikitude!

This plugin is built by a team with a vision. We follow a moral code and value the plugin’s security, your privacy and the documentation of our work. Read our [mission statement](https://www.mapsmarker.com/our-vision-and-mission-statement/) here.
