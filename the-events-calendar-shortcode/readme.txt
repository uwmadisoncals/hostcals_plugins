= How do I use this shortcode in a widget? =

* You can put the shortcode in a text widget.
* Not all themes support use of a shortcode in a widget. If a regular text widget doesn't work, put the shortcode in a <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/black-studio-tinymce-widget/">Visual Editor Widget</a>.

= What are the classes for styling the list of events? =
By default the plugin does not include styling. Events are listed in ul li tags with appropriate classes for styling.

* ul class="ecs-event-list"
* li class="ecs-event"
* event title link is H4 class="entry-title summary"
* date class is time
* venue class is venue
* span .ecs-all-events
* p .ecs-excerpt
